# Personal Claude Notes

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Mode Default

- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately – don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy

- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Verification Before Done

- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 4. Demand Elegance (Balanced)

- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes – don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 5. Autonomous Bug Fixing

- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests – then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`


## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.

## Shared Dotfiles & Tasks

Bare-worktree setup at `$DOTFILES_DIR` (`~/.config`) enables parallel branch management and provides shared mise tasks for both worktree operations and dotfiles maintenance.

**Common daily-use tasks:**
- `worktree:branch [branch-name]` — Create a worktree for development on a new or existing branch
- `worktree:status` — Monitor all worktrees for dirty state and ahead/behind remote
- `worktree:sync [branch]` — Keep worktree in sync with remote
- `worktree:list` — View all active worktrees and branches

**Bootstrap & maintenance tasks:**
- `dotfiles:install` — Full installation (one-time)
- `dotfiles:update` — Update tools and configurations
- `dotfiles:doctor` — Health check

See `/Users/seth/.claude/dotfiles-reference.md` for detailed worktree workflows, environment variables, and complete task documentation.
